# DBMS-Project
There exists a lack of user privacy and slow movie selection process for users upon searching for the next movie
and the recommendation provided by the server in conventional websites. The slow movie selection process leads
users to waste most of their free time in just searching for the right taste in movie. To solve this problem, we propose
a method to give recommendations to by asking the user’s current mood not by searching for their past history, thus
ensuring that user’s needs are met with minimal problems.
